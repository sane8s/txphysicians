## About
https://library.tmc.edu/mcgovern/roster-of-deceased-texas-physicians/
The Roster of Deceased Texas Physicians (TX Physicians) is a database that provides references to obituaries, biographical information and archival resources for 13,321 Texas physicians born in the early 19th century to death dates in 2009. The Roster lists physicians and information such as birth and death dates, date of graduation, specialty and primary location. Information was drawn from the Dallas Medical Journal (1920-1990), the Texas State Journal of Medicine (1905-1956) and licensure records from the Texas State Board of Medical Examiners Collection. Obituaries from state, regional and local sources were used as sources from 1990-2009. This list is as comprehensive as time and resources allowed and does not purport to be complete.

## Background of online access
Currently the complete Dead Docs database is only available to the public as 16 PDFs uploaded to The TMC Library Institutional Repository, Digital Commons, https://digitalcommons.library.tmc.edu/gazetteer/. The PDFs are report printouts dividing all 13,000+ Docs by surname, A through Z. Despite the inefficient nature of these documents, they are full-text searchable and many users download them each month.

In 2012, an in-house programmer created a useful web application using Cold Fusion Markup Language that allowed users and library staff to easily search the database online. When the library website was redesigned in 2014, the cold fusion server was taken offline and the web application was no longer available. 

In 2024, Wende Wang adapted the database converting it to mysql and developed a web application based in php. In the course of the project, he made significant contributions to the web application framework developed by Sandra Yates (github.com/sane8s). Contributions include development of advanced search form, dynamic count of results, database management, and image integration.
